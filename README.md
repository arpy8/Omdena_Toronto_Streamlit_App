# Chest X-ray Analysis using Deep Learning

![banner](assets/banner.png)

This project is the final streamlit app developed for Omdena Myanmar Chapter

## Project Goal

The project's primary objective is to create an AI-driven healthcare 
solution for chest X-ray analysis, disease detection, and COVID-19 diagnosis, utilizing deep learning algorithms. 
To begin, an extensive literature review will be conducted, informing the project's goals. A diverse dataset of 
chest X-ray images, encompassing COVID-19 cases and other chest diseases, will be collected and preprocessed for 
model training. Exploratory data analysis will be performed to reveal insights and potential 
biases.<br><br>Choosing the most appropriate deep learning algorithm or architecture will be a key step, 
considering factors such as complexity, interpretability, and computational requirements. The selected model will 
be implemented, trained, and optimized to achieve precise disease detection. Additionally, a user-friendly web or 
mobile app will be developed to provide real-time results for uploaded chest X-ray images.<br><br>The final 
solution will be deployed in a secure, scalable hosting environment. Comprehensive project documentation and a 
final presentation will be delivered to showcase results and the solution's potential impact on healthcare. 
Knowledge sharing and open discussions about AI-driven healthcare solutions will be encouraged.

## Requirements

To run this locally, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.8 or above
- Streamlit

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run Web Application Locally

To start the system, run the following command in your terminal:

```shell
streamlit run main.py
```

Once the application is running, you can access it through your web browser. The user interface will prompt you to input the relevant parameters such as pH levels, temperature, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen. After providing the required inputs, click the "Predict Water Quality" button to obtain the predicted water quality result for the specified location.
